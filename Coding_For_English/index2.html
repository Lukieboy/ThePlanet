                <p class="main"><span><br><strong>PLANET EARTHâ€”</strong></span>Here is the place where I am supposed to write something weird and funny about satire, but I didn't spend any time working on it so probably won't be. I have no clue how to write satire. I'm just trying to get good marks in English, ok? Could I PLEASE get 8? Thanks in advance (for the 8)!</p>
